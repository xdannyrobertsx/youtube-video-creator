2.  Select an audio file to use for the video.
3.  Select one or more image files to use for the video.
4.  Choose the output file name and location.
5.  Wait for the script to finish running.
6.  The output video file will be saved in the location specified in step 4.

Note: The script only accepts audio files in the .mp3 or .wav formats, and image files in .png, .jpg, or .jpeg formats.

## Troubleshooting

-   If you receive an error about a missing package, make sure that you have installed the required packages listed above.
-   If the script crashes or hangs, try using fewer image files or selecting a shorter audio file.
-   If the output file does not play correctly, try using a different video player or uploading the file to YouTube to see if the problem is with the player or the file itself.
